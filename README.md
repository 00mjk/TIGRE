TIGRE: Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction Toolbox
======

TIGRE is a GPU toolbox for fast and accurate 3D tomographic 
reconstruction, created jointly by University of Bath's Engineering Tomography Lab and CERN. 







## Features

TIGRE is, mainly, a GPU-based CT recosnturction tool that contains a wide range of iterative algorithms.

TIGRE features:

- A MATLAB and python library for high performance multi-GPU based X-ray absorbtion tomography recosntruction

- State of the art implementations of projection and backprojection operations on GPUs, with easy interface with higher level languages in order to ease delevoping of new methods.

- **Flexible CT geometry:** Cone Beam, Parallel Beam, Digital Tomosynthesis, C-arm CT, an any other geometry. Geometric parameters are defined per projection, not per scan.

- A wide range of recosntruction algorithms for CT

	- Filtered Backprojection (FBP,FDK) and variations (different filters, Parker weights, ...)
	
	- **Iterative algorithms** 
	    
		- Gradient based algorithms (SART, OS-SART, SIRT) with multiple tuning parameters (Nesterov acceleration, initialization, parameter reduction, ...)
		
		- Krylov Subspace algorithms (CGLS)
		
		- Statistical recosntruction (MLEM)
		
		- Total Variation regularization based algorithms: FISTA-based (SART-TV) and POCS based (ASD-POCS, OS-ASD-POCS, B-ASD-POCS-Î², PCSD, AwPCSD, Aw-ASD-POCS)
		
- TV denoising for 3D images
		
- Basic image loading fucntionality
		
- A variety of plotting functions
		
- Image quality metrics.
