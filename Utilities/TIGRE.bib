  abstract={An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.}

abstract = {A convolution-backprojection formula is deduced for direct reconstruction of a three-dimensional density function from a set of two-dimensional projections. The formula is approximate but has useful properties, including errors that are relatively small in many practical instances and a form that leads to convenient computation. It reduces to the standard fan-beam formula in the plane that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation and contains the point source. The algorithm is applied to a mathematical phantom as an example of its performance.},
